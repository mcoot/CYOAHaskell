[TITLE Story File Test]

[PAGE p_start]
[PROMPT playerName String] What is your name?
You are $playerName, and you are a fish detective.
That is, you are a detective who investigates the disappearance of fish, not a fish who is a detective.
It's a dark and stormy night in an unnamed but suitably noir-ish city.
As you loiter on the street, your face silhoutted by the dim light from a street lamp, a man in a trench coat approaches.
The man seems shady, but so does anyone out on the street at night in a city ripped from a detective novel.
[ASSIGN] didRunFromStranger = false
[CHOICE p_talktoman] Say hello to the stranger
[CHOICE p_runfromman] Try to run away from the stranger

[PAGE p_runfromman]
[ASSIGN didRunFromStranger Bool] true
The stranger seems a little *too* shady, so you, as calmly as possible, leg it.
You abruptly begin walking. You quickly break into a run, and then into a sprint.
The man speeds up to catch you, seemingly confirming your fears.
He's struggling to keep up, and you turn a corner in the hopes of losing him.
Unfortunately, small step right around the corner trips you, and you hit the grimy concrete palms first.
As you try to get up, your assailant rounds the corner.
He shouts at you to stop. At this point, you don't really have a choice.
[CHOICE p_giveuprunning] Give up
[CHOICE p_continuerunning] Attempt to escape

[PAGE p_continuerunning]
You scramble to your feet and attempt to get away.
As you get up, you lose your sense of balance, which sends you off course and onto the road, right in the path of an oncoming car.
You see the car, but there is no time to react, and it smashes into you, killing you instantly.
[ENDING] You died.

[PAGE p_giveuprunning]
You collapse to the ground, panting. It's over. You're at the stranger's mercy.
The man offers his hand to you and helps you up. Most importantly, he does not attempt to stab or otherwise murder you.
Once you're on your feet, you dust yourself off; finally, you are face to face with him.

$playerName: So, uh... hi.
STRANGER: ::? didRunFromStranger ? Looks like you've taken a bit of a tumble... : Hello. ?::
STRANGER: Sorry if I scared you. This situation is a bit fluid right now, and I can't take any chances.
[ENDING] Lol the end
